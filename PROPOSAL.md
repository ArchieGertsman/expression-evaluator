# Project Proposal
  For my final project, I propose to develop an application in which the user sketches a mathematical expression with the cursor, and the application evaluates the sketch, returning an answer. The expression can contain natural numbers and operators +, -, x, and /.
  To implement the GUI, I will create a C++/[openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) windowed application. To parse the drawn sketch into a string expression, I will be using the [PyTorch library](https://pytorch.org/) to model a neural network, and will use stochastic gradient descent to find weights and biases which will minimize the network's cost function. All of this backend code will of course be writen in Python and will be natively called from the C++ program. The Python script will then give the parsed expression back to the C++ application in string form, and the C++ application will use the [ExprTk library](http://partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html) to evaluate the expression. The integer answer will be displayed in the GUI.
